    ### Executor for Dynamic Quantity to Risk
    This executor uses risks a percentage of the account balance to determine the quantity to trade.

    Args:
        strategy (BaseStrategy): The strategy instance
        maximum_costbasis (float): The maximum cost basis for the trade. Default is 200,000.
        minimum_costbasis (float): The minimum cost basis for the trade. Default is 1,000.

    #### How it works:
    When a new insight is generated, the executor calculates the quantity to trade based on the percentage of the account balance which is a percentage of insight.confidence * RISK.

    Note: limit price and stop loss levels must be set in the insight before using this executor.
